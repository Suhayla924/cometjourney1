        A COMET'S JOURNEY
      </h1>
      <h2>
        a virtual emulation of the formation and paths a comet takes when it is in space.

        This website was created to emulate the journey of a comet in outer space. The website is formatted to mimic the layout of a “pop-up book” to give the website a creative flare and make the experience more enjoyable to the user. During the development of this website, I wanted to see how well I could design an interactive website with only using HTML and CSS. While it is possible I felt that it took a lot of time and patience to create a website by just using those two tools. Moreover, I chose to create a website emulating a comet because it is an object rarely seen in person, yet hundreds of comets form in space from floating debris we just are unable to witness it. I find space to be mysterious and intriguing and I hope this website evokes viewer’s curiosity about the unknown occurrences of cosmic space.
